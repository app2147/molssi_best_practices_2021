A Python package for analyzing and visualizing molecular files. This was created as a part of a MolSSI workshop May 2021. This package has a functions module. 

This repository is currently under development. To do a developmental install, download this repository and type

`pip install -e .`

This package also requires the following packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib

Features should be developed on branches. To create and switch to a branch, us command

`git checkout -b new_branch_name`

To switch back to an existing branch, use

`git checkout new_branch_name`

I added this line from GitHub.
